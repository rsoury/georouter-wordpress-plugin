Web Doodle GeoRouter Plugin enables you auto-redirect website visitors using IP geolocation technology. Configure your routing by continent, country, state & city.

== Description ==

**Features**
1. Dynamic widgets: Show a dropdown for region selection, or a popup for region suggestion.
2. Cookie-based preferences: Manual region selection is saved to the browser.
3. VPN safe: Visitors using a VPN may provide incorrect geolocation results, but can fallback to using the manual region selection widget.
4. SEO friendly: Query/UTM parameters are retained in redirect ensuring campaign tracking. Routing logic is ignored if the website visitor is a Search Bot ensuring Search Engines index correctly.

**No-code set up**
1. Create a new configuration. Each group of websites requires its own group of routing rules.
2. Configure your routing rules. Install our code snippet.
3. Choose to have our specialists install the code snippet for you at no additional charge for a truly no-code experience.

**How does it work?**
GeoRouter works by loading a small widget on your website. This widget identifies the website visitors' IP-based Geolocation and performs a redirect or suggests a pop-up accordingly.
GeoRouter can also load in a widget that allows website visitors to select their Country-Specific website.

**Why use Web Doodle GeoRouter?**
GeoRouter allows your website visitors to see the best website appropriate to their region.
If you're offering different prices, different language, or are simply tailoring different websites to different regions, GeoRouter will help route your website visitors accordingly.
